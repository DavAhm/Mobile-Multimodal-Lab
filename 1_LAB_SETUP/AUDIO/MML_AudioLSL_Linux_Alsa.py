MOBILE MULTIMODAL LAB (MML): AUDIO STREAMING SCRIPT FOR LSL
------------------------------------------------------
This script captures live audio using ALSA (Linux-only) and streams it to
Lab Streaming Layer (LSL), where it can be synchronized with other modalities
(e.g., video, physiology) in multimodal experiments.

Typical use case:
- Each participant wears a head-mounted mic
- MINIX Linux device auto-runs this script on boot
- Audio stream appears in LSL for recording/visualization

Requirements:
- Python 3
- pyalsa (alsaaudio), pylsl, numpy
- Linux OS with ALSA audio system

About the first lines (shebang):
- The line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` is called a shebang.
- It tells the operating system to run this script using Python 3 when launched directly from the terminal (e.g., `./script.py`).
- If commented out, it has no effect â€” the script can still be run via `python3 script.py`, but not directly.
